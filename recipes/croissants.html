        French croissants, those golden crescents of culinary perfection, are a sensory symphony of indulgence.
        Delicately crafted with layers of buttery, flaky pastry that yields to a satisfying crunch, each bite is an
        exquisite blend of simplicity and sophistication. The alluring aroma of freshly baked croissants fills the air,
        while the rich, butter-infused layers create a melt-in-your-mouth experience. Perfectly crisp on the outside and
        luxuriously soft on the inside, these pastries are a testament to French pastry artistry, inviting you to savor
        the timeless elegance and unparalleled pleasure that a well-made croissant brings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Crafting the perfect French croissants is a labor of love, requiring patience and precision. Begin by combining
        flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a bowl. Mix in warm milk until a dough forms, then chill it for an hour. Roll
        out the chilled dough into a rectangle and place a generous layer of butter in the center, folding the dough
        over it to create distinct layers. Repeat this process multiple times, allowing the dough to rest between folds,
        fostering the development of those coveted flaky layers. After the final fold, refrigerate the dough overnight.
        The next day, roll out the dough, cut it into triangles, and shape them into crescents. Let them proof until
        doubled in size, then bake until golden brown. The result: a batch of heavenly French croissants, with a crispy
        exterior that gives way to a buttery, tender interior – the epitome of artisanal baking that transports you to a
        Parisian patisserie with every bite.

    <h2>To make French croissants, you'll need the following ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 1/4 cups (400g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (50g) sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) warm milk</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups (280g) unsalted butter, cold</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) cold water</li>
        <li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Activate the yeast:</h4>
            <p>Dissolve the yeast in warm milk and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Combine dry ingredients:</h4>
            <p>In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the yeast mixture and mix until a dough forms.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Chill the dough:</h4>
            <p>Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Laminate the dough:</h4>
            <p>Roll out the chilled dough into a rectangle. Place cold, thinly sliced butter on two-thirds of the dough.
                Fold the uncovered third over the butter-covered middle third, then fold the remaining third over the
                top. This creates the first layer. Chill the dough for 30 minutes. Repeat this rolling and folding
                process at least two more times, chilling between each turn.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Shape the croissants:</h4>
            <p>Roll out the laminated dough into a large rectangle. Cut smaller triangles from the dough and roll each
                triangle into a crescent shape.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Proofing:</h4>
            <p>Place the shaped croissants on a baking sheet, cover them, and let them proof at room temperature until
                doubled in size.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Preheat and egg wash:</h4>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Beat an egg and brush it over the tops of the proofed croissants for a
                golden finish.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Bake:</h4>
            <p>Bake the croissants in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until they are golden brown and flaky.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cool and enjoy:</h4>
            <p>Allow the croissants to cool slightly before indulging in the buttery, flaky goodness.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    Remember, making croissants is a bit of an art, and practice will help you perfect the technique. Enjoy the process
    and savor the delightful results!
