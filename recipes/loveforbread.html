        Sajid Loves
        French Breads</h1>
    <p><em>In August 2023, Sajid went to <b>Paris</b></em>.</p>
    <p>It was the last destination of his Europe Tour from where he flew to
        his home back again. I stayed for 3 days in Paris.</p>
    <p>Paris if known for it's bakeries after <b><big>Eiffel Tower</big></b> and <strong>love locks</strong>. So in
        Paris Sajid
        tried few of the famous
        breads. Mostly Crossaints. Sajid actually loved them and wish to visit Paris again and enjoy a picnic in the
        very famous
        <strong>Trocadero Gardens</strong> with his <b>French girlfriend</b>!

    <h3>For the French, le pain is a national birthright and much more than a standalone ingredient. French bread is
        about expression and tradition, and the innumerable variations and styles each have a place in the choreography
        of everyday life.
