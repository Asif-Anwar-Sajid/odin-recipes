        <li>1 cup (240ml) warm milk</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups (280g) unsalted butter, cold</li>

        <p>For the Filling:</p>
        <li>High-quality dark chocolate, cut into small squares</li>

        <p>For Egg Wash:</p>
        <li>1 egg, beaten
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Activate the yeast:</h4>
            <p>Dissolve the yeast in warm milk and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until frothy.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Mix dry ingredients:</h4>
            <p>In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Add the yeast mixture and mix to form a dough.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Chill the dough:</h4>
            <p>Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Laminate the dough:</h4>
            <p>Roll out the chilled dough into a rectangle. Place cold, thinly sliced butter on two-thirds of the dough.
                Fold the uncovered third over the butter-covered middle third, then fold the remaining third over the
                top. Chill, then repeat this rolling and folding process at least two more times.
