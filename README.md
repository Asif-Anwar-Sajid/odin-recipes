This is the first course of the odin-project. This is a basic website made with pure HTML. A fun project for me of course since I'll be adding the recipes of my top three favourite breads from Paris. But let me tell you, "Croissant" will be my most favourite till I go to Paris again and try other breads. Hope it will be interesting!

Learnings: 
    1. Pure HTML
    2. Creating projects is fun
